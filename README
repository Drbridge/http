Was developed for an assignment as a part of Computer Networks course (IIT Kharagpur Computer Science Autumn 2009).

NOTE:
0) Both HTTPClientMain and HTTPProxyMain depend on running the DNSServer
1) URL for HTTPClientMain must end with /

DNSServer:
----------
./DNSServer <ip1> <ip2> ..

ip1, ip2 are DNS Servers that our secondary (tertiary?) server can depend on. This could also simply be localhost if your Linux distribution runs dnsmasq.

e.g.

./DNSServer 8.8.4.4 4.2.2.2
./DNSServer localhost
./DNSServer 8.8.4.4

HTTPServerMain:
--------------

./HTTPServerMain <port> to start the HTTP server on the specified port. If port argument isn't given, the server runs on port 80 by default.

HTTPClientMain:
---------------

./HTTPClientMain <method> <url> <localFileName> <direct/proxyaddress>

method can be GET or PUT
url is in the form http://server:port/remotepath
if a proxy is not needed, enter "direct", else enter the proxyserver url

./HTTPClientMain GET http://xkcd.com/ latestcomic.html direct
./HTTPClientMain GET http://xkcd.com/ latestcomic.html 127.0.0.1:10000


HTTPProxyMain:
--------------

./HTTPProxyMain <port>

If port is not provided, the proxy runs on default port 8080

./HTTPProxyMain 10000
